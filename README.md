AI assistant that can answer questions from doctors’ notes.

## Problem

Doctors spend a significant amount of time reading notes as part of their workflow. A study published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine in 2016 found that primary care physicians spent an average of 18.4 minutes per patient encounter reading and writing electronic health record notes. This includes reviewing previous notes, writing new notes, and reviewing test results.

## Solution

To help healthcare providers manage doctors’ notes, we have developed an AI assistant that can answer questions from the notes. Questions may be related to patient history, follow-ups, medication adjustments, treatment, diagnosis, procedures, and other categories.
